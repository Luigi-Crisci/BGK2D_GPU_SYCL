Description

In this directory you can perform some simulation of Von Karman Streets (VKS).
The initial condition is rest flow inflow at x=0 used.
Inflow/Outflow B.C. along x direction (streamwise) and periodic B.C. alonf y direction (normal to wall) are applied.
Different scripts (*.x) will allow you to:
        1) Compile the code in different configurations
        2) Run the code, in a "ad hoc" created directory

There are some script (runMe.*.sh) to perform multiple simulation and check the results using gnuplot

To run VKS test use the following scripts (each one create a different directory)

* run.single.gpu.fused.dc.nv.x   --> single precision, gpu, fused, do concurrent using NVIDIA compiler
* run.single.gpu.fused.offload.nv.x   --> single precision, gpu, fused, offload using NVIDIA compiler
* run.single.gpu.fused.openacc.nv.x   --> single precision, gpu, fused, openacc using NVIDIA compiler


bgk.input        --> input file used for the simulation
plot.gnu         --> gnuplot file to check the results between different precisions (NVIDIA)

runMe.1.sh --> Running 3 simulation using GPU,FUSED and nvidia compiler (dc, offload, openacc)
